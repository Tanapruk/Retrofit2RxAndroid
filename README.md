# Retrofit2RxAndroid
An example structure of using retrofit2 with RxAndroid and its error handling

### Tools use:
1. Retrofit2
2. RxAndroid and RxJava
 

### Why this ?
* In Retrofit1, if you do not place retrofit stuff inside the Activity class, you have to callback from another class. And I'm lazy so I use [Otto](http://square.github.io/otto/). However, it is now deprecated and is recommended to use RxAndroid instead.
* Fortunately, Retrofit2 came out and officially supported RxAndroid. I take a while to get a hang of it. I kind of understanding some of its basic, so I put it in to this repo.
